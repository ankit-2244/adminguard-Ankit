Refactor the validation system to use a centralized RULE_CONFIG object.
Create:
const RULE_CONFIG = {
minAge: 18,
maxFutureGradYears: 2,
minPercentage: 60,
minCGPA: 6.0,
minScreeningScore: 40,
highRiskThreshold: 2
}
Update all strict and soft rule validations to use values from RULE_CONFIG instead of hardcoded numbers.
Also:
Add a small section on top of the form called:
"Admin Rule Configuration (Demo)"
Display current rule values in read-only format.
Do not break existing logic.
Do not remove strict vs soft distinction.
Just refactor to use centralized config.
